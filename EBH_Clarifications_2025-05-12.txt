    {
      "turn": 23,
      "clarification": "User expressed skepticism toward integrity testing due to perceived system fragility and risk of faking. This was framed with deference to subject matter experts and not as a knowledge claim."
    },
    {
      "turn": 25,
      "clarification": "Metaphorical language ('eat the soul of your organization') refers to measurable cultural damage like eroded trust, morale, or interpersonal conflict."
    },
    {
      "turn": 27,
      "clarification": "Cost concern includes not just the financial cost of the test, but also downstream costs from misclassification, cultural risk, and supplemental tools needed to offset known fragilities."
    },
    {
      "turn": 31,
      "clarification": "Phrase 'overly clear-headed' was rhetorical emphasis meant to instruct the LLM to avoid editorial or lofty framing."
    },
    {
      "turn": 33,
      "clarification": "User's view was evolving. Now holds the view that integrity tests are functionally useful but potentially fragile from a systems perspective. Deference to SMEs is sustained."
    },
    {
      "turn": 41,
      "clarification": "User was speculating about whether LLMs change the limits of what can be studied in unstructured interview research. This was a hypothesis under uncertainty."
    },
    {
      "turn": 43,
      "clarification": "User was forming an idea that LLMs could extract high-quality data from unstructured interviews, allowing them to scale and possibly outperform structured interviews. Expressed during early ideation."
    },
    {
      "turn": 45,
      "clarification": "Distinction made between traditional unstructured interviews and passive conversational data like this one. Analysis happens after the fact; LLM is not actively interviewing."
    },
    {
      "turn": 49,
      "clarification": "Analysis is not concurrent. LLM performs assessment only post hoc. Clarifying that no trait inference is being performed during conversation."
    },
    {
      "turn": 51,
      "clarification": "User sensed high predictive and structural value in cross-domain LLM conversations but was unable to articulate the exact mechanism at that time."
    },
    {
      "turn": 53,
      "clarification": "User theorized that natural dialogue is hard to fake, and a 'trust but verify' system could increase reliability. The phrase 'only way to fake it is to possess the traits' reflects this reasoning."
    },
    {
      "turn": 55,
      "clarification": "Speculative forecast rooted in analogical reasoning (e.g., mobile phone adoption curve). Designed to explain likely adoption patterns, not assert outcomes as certain."
    },
    {
      "turn": 59,
      "clarification": "Future-state forecast that LLMs will construct their own prompts or frameworks based on accumulated interaction and use-patterns. Not current behavior."
    },
    {
      "turn": 61,
      "clarification": "Prediction that high-value candidates will adopt and benefit from LLM-generated profiles, leading to organizational adoption. Based on observed historic behavioral analogs."
    },
    {
      "turn": 63,
      "clarification": "User was checking accuracy of prior memory and seeking confirmation about structured interviews requiring top-down support."
    },
    {
      "turn": 65,
      "clarification": "Prediction framed conversationally to allow pause or disagreement. Internally held as a high-probability outcome about employer adoption of LLMs."
    },
    {
      "turn": 67,
      "clarification": "User believed the behavior described was typical of humans and would occur naturally, not necessarily that it was ideal from a hiring-process design perspective."
    },
    {
      "turn": 69,
      "clarification": "Statement reflects present activity of building systems that future LLMs will automate. 'Won\u2019t need prompting' refers to user-facing experience, not internal agent operation."
    },
    {
      "turn": 73,
      "clarification": "Statement was an open-ended prompt to invite disagreement or refinement from the LLM. Typical of user's dialogic style to encourage reflective feedback."
    },
    {
      "turn": 75,
      "clarification": "Statement was a request to verify mutual understanding and completeness of system summary. Seeks alignment, not validation."
